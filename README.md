# ASM for ARM64 arch. 

I have interesting thought , all people start study programming from hight level p.l. (programming language) . And i'm think is cool , it allow u keep focus on really interesting things and keep interesting in programming . But after two years i understand that stop growing up , and i don't say about tools that i can learn , i say about challenges for me from myself . All tools i see i can replay , for me as for young person important to keep feeling of heaviness . After that i start learning com arch. and write on base ASM . I do it not for to be come a master of asm or com arhc. , i want to understand how work computer for creating something more
